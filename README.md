# Machine-Learning-on-Red-Wine-Quality-Dataset-
Applying Data Science Methodology on Red Wine Quality Dataset to determine which features are the best quality red wine indicators and generate insights into each of these factors to our modelâ€™s red wine quality. 

To Complete this task we did the following:

- Feature Scaling to Normalize the data(comparing the histogram/KDE for MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler)
- Implemented both Multivariable Linear Regression using scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas
- Neural Network using TensorFlow and Keras
